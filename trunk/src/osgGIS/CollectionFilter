     * A filter that collects incoming data and meters it out in batches.
     *
     * Normally, data (such as features or fragments) passes through a graph
     * one element at a time. A collection filter will "collect" elements,
     * wait until a checkpoint is reached, and then meter the collected
     * elements out in batches.
     * 
     * Since most filters have the options of processing data either in 
     * batches or one element at a time, a collection filter is useful for
     * combining related features or for enabling optimization. 
     *
     * For example: The CombineLinesFilter optimizes line layers by combining
     * line segments that share endpoints into single line strips, reducing the
     * number of features and helping performance. Since this filter needs to
     * access all incoming features as a group and compare them, you must precede
     * it with a CollectionFilter.
     *
     * Another possible use for a collection filter would be to save the state
     * of the graph to support partial compilation or data caching. This is
     * not yet implemented but will be in the future.
