     * A Feature Layer is a grouping of features that together comprise a
     * meaningful dataset. All the features in a layer share a commmon spatial
     * reference (SRS), a common attribute table schema, and (usually) a
     * common shape type.
     *
     * Examples of feature layers would be "buildings" or "streets" or "political
     * "boundaries". It usually makes sense in the application to treat a feature
     * layer as a cohesive unit.
     *
     * A FeatureLayer sits atop a FeatureStore (which provides access to the actual
     * GIS backing store) and adds useful functionality like spatial indexing and
     * layer-level attribution.
     *
     * The osgGIS compiler framework operates on the FeatureLayer level. You 
     * generally create a compiler and tell it to generate geometry for some subset
     * of a FeatureLayer.
