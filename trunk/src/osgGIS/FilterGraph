     * A chain of data-processing filters.
     *
     * A FilterGraph is a sequence of discrete data-processing units called Filters.
     * The compiler will run a graph using a set of input features (typically
     * from a FeatureStore/Featurelayer) and a filter environment (FilterEnv)
     * that communicates the current spatial context. The compiler passes data
     * from filter to filter until it reaches the end of the chain. It then
     * invokes getOutput() and returns the resulting scene graph to the caller.
     *
     * Although some basic type validation occurs, the responsibility lies with
     * the caller to build a working graph that passes compatible data down the
     * chain.
